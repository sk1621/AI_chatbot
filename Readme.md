This code will execute 4 process 

* one will show the answers for functions like mean,median, mode,average and describe.
* will show the bar graph.
* will show the summary of the given data. (what the column names tells about. how many numeircal colns, categorical colns,
  data types of each column, std, variance, percentiles like that).
* final one shows what are the graphs or charts we might use from this dataset. will show suggestions.

packages like 

* streamlit for UI. (doesnot work on api and also on DB...)
* used ollama LLM models
* langchain for integration
* nlp for user inputs tokenization 
* and other packages like pandas, matplotlib and seaborn are used 


possibile areas to improve the result 
####### need to add other local files also it should give the same output as expected as sql.....(use separate chatbot page)
################ after completing local file uploads need to push it into hugging face streamlit site....

########### need to add date columns also in the graph.......

################# need to add line chart **********************

############### kpi, pareto charts,histogram need to be worked and bubble.....
######### how can we integrate this in cloud.... either deployments or data receiving anything 
############# multi agents concepts...

############## not showing all values if it excites more show it in next page in full view mode or
